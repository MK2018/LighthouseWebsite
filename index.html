        <p>Lighthouse is an Android application that helps find temporary places to stay for victims of attacks or natural catastrophes.
            It was inspired by the <a href="http://time.com/4112428/paris-shootings-porte-ouverte/">#porteouverte</a> movement after the 2015 Paris attacks.</p>
        <p>The Github repository for the app is located <a href="http://github.com/alex-gurung/lighthouse" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Lighthouse works by matching generous homeowners with those who have been displaced by unfortunate incidents based on their location, duration of stay, and capacity. The focus is on finding shelter as quickly as possible.</p>
